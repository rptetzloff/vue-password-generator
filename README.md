## Credits

* Word List was obtained from the [EFF Large Wordlist for Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) on 2019-05-07 and converted to a straight comma-separated word list. The [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) is amazing.
* Word lists for passphrases were generated from [alt12dicts] (https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/blob/master/alt12dicts/2of12id.txt) and filtered through [google-10000-english] (https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).
* Thanks to [XKPassword](https://xkpasswd.net/s/) and [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/936/) for inspiration.
